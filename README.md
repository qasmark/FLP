## Description

Haskell is a purely functional programming language that offers powerful abstractions for solving problems. Prolog, on the other hand, is focused on logical programming and is used for working with rules and facts.

This repository contains the following laboratory works:

- Introduction to Haskell
- Function in Haskell
- Recursion in Haskell
- Logical Inference in Prolog
- And much more, but I don't like it...

## Requirements

To work with the laboratory assignments, you will need:

- [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) version 9.8.1
- [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

## Installation

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qasmark/FLP.git
