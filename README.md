# Laboratory Works in Haskell and Prolog

Welcome to the repository containing laboratory works in the programming languages Haskell and Prolog. Here you will find assignments, code examples, and solutions to help you better understand functional and logical programming.

## Description

Haskell is a purely functional programming language that offers powerful abstractions for solving problems. Prolog, on the other hand, is focused on logical programming and is used for working with rules and facts.

This repository contains the following laboratory works:

- Introduction to Haskell
- Function in Haskell
- Recursion in Haskell
- Logical Inference in Prolog
- And much more, but I don't like it...

## Requirements

To work with the laboratory assignments, you will need:

- [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) version 9.8.1
- [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
